	<p style="color:green; font-size: 18px">Common in fiction and certain styles of journalistic or other nonfiction writing, a descriptive paragraph contains various details of the same thing, with each sentence adding new insight.<b><u>A paragraph in a horror novel might describe how it feels walking around the woods alone; a love letter’s paragraph might focus on the details of your significant other’s eyes.</u></b> No matter the context, descriptive paragraphs are meant to provide the clearest picture of your subject. </p>

	<p style="color: blue; font-size: 18px">If you’re telling a story, fiction or nonfiction, you’ll need to break up the action into digestible segments so your reader doesn’t get confused. That’s the purpose of narrative paragraphs: they break up sequential actions into related chunks, with one leading into the next, so that the reader can remain focused on the storyline. They don’t use evidence or supporting arguments like the other paragraph types, but they still abide by the main rule of paragraphs about unity. </p>
